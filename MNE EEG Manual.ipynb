    "- This guide is necessarily incomplete and there are very likely more optimal ways of doing certain things that aren't touched upon here. **Use it as a reference and guiding tool, but do not treat it as the end all be all and recognize that there may likely be mistakes/misinformation so be sure to sanity check things for yourself.**\n",
    "- This guide is intimately linked to the MNE-Python suite as this is what we use to analyze the data.\n",
    "- This guide should always be evolving. Add to it and correct errors and out of date information. Do not let it become static.\n",
    "- This guide is a mix of theory and practical walkthroughs. Thus, it is optimally used if one takes advantage of both aspects, but alternatively it can be used in a primarily practical manner.\n",

    "The cart lives down by the digitization system by bay 1. The cart along with the black box containing the wiring for the cart needs to be wheeled up to the behavioral testing room. Importantly, the keys for the cart live in a lock box by the digitization computer. The combination for the lock box is 3256.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cart contains the following components:\n",
    "- Physiological Recordings Laptop: A macbook pro serves as the recording laptop. \n",
    "- Black box: This serves as the interface between the recording laptop and the amplifier. What else??\n",
    "- Amplifier: This lives inside the cart and amplifies the EEG electrode recordings. It runs on battery power, but should be plugged in regardless during recording to ensure it remains charged.\n",

    "** Preparing the Cap Solution **\n",
    "\n",
    "The EGI cap is a saline cap, meaning that the electrodes are connected to the scalp via mini sponges that get soaked with a liquid solution designed to form a connective bridge between the electrode and the scalp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cap solution materials are in the second black plastic bin stored with the cart (the one that doesn't have the wiring). The solution is a mixture of tap water, baby shampoo, and sodium. In the plastic bin (and surrounding area) there should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plastic container where solution gets mixed. \n",
    "- Baby shampoo bottles.\n",
    "- Sodium Chloride mixture.\n",
    "- Two scoops. One for shampoo & one for the KCL.\n",
    "- A tupperware container.\n",
    "- Scissors\n",
    "- Two plastic squeeze droppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take all of these materials to the sink by bay 1. There, follow the instructions on the plastic container for creating the solution **with the exception that all of the ingredients should be doubled.** The reason for doubling is that the amount of solution made with the given steps often doesn't seem enough to sufficiently soak the cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET LINENS IN HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "After making the solution there are two final steps. First, you should take two plastic squeeze droppers and cut off the ends about an inch up. These will be used to both move the hair during electrode placement and will also be used to administer extra solution during impedance checking. The ends are removed to make them less flimsy at the tips. Second, some of the saline solution should be extracted into the tupperware container. This will be used to improve the connection for electrodes that have poor impedance readings up in the experiment room.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Capping the Subject **\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when capping the subject is to measure the subject's head circumference. This is done by placing the tape measure end at the nasion and wrapping it around the head so that it runs across the bump at the back of the head. Record this measure in cm. This will be used to determine the cap size. HOW DOES IT TRANSLATE TO CAP SIZE?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the cap size has been determined, place the head of the cap INSIDE OUT in the saline solution bucket. Wrap a pair of scrub pants securely around the end to keep it from getting wet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to locate the vertex (top, center of the head). The vertex will serve as an important landmark as this is where the reference electrode will be positioned. The reference electrode is a black electrode in the top center of the cap. To locate the vertex, take the tape measure and stretch it from the nasion to the bump on the back over the top of the head. Find the middle of this distance and draw a red mark perpendicular to the measuring tape at the center point. Repeat this process, but this time going from aricular point to aricular point. The result should be a red cross-hairs at the approximate vertex location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally place\n",
    "\n",
    "Next place the cap over (there should hopefully be a video) and adjust. ADD MORE HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you want to move hair out of the way of electrodes using the squeegees. ADD MORE HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "** Digitization Process **\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in the MEG bay, the digitization process is done offline. Instead, what we do here is take multi-angle images of the cap which are then used later to perform the digitization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to log onto the digitization computer. This entails the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enter the password: geodesic\n",
    "- Open the image capture program at the following in finder: Applications > EGI > GPS > GPS Acquisition\n",
    "- ENTER SOMETHING ELSE IN HERE?\n",
    "- Select 'Hydro Cel GSN 256 1.0' for the net size\n",
    "- Enter patient info as desired for naming the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to position the dome around the subject. The dome consists of 11 cameras that together capture all of the electrodes on the head.\n",

    "1. Pour out the container with the saline solution and rinse clean. Then fill it up with warm water to the 2 Liter mark. Take the cap and repeatedly dunk in and out of the water for 20 seconds. Remove from water and pour out the water.\n",
    "2. Repeat step 1 three more times.\n",
    "Use a timer for the next two steps. The cap should remain in the disinfectant for no more than 10 minutes as otherwise it can start to erode the electrodes!\n",
    "3. Open the disinfectant container (check to make sure it hasn't expired! The disinfectant is only good for 30 days.). Dunk the cap in and out repeatedly for two minutes.\n",

    "    - Take 3 syringes and fill with the electrode gel. Take the pusher all the way out. Then put the electrode gel nozzle as far down as possible angled against the side of the tube and squeeze. Try to get the gel to travel downwards as far as possible before the gel forms a seal against both sides and starts forcing it upwards. Do this until the syringe is full. Then place the pusher back in and push until the gel is flush without any air pockets. Do this over the trash as gel will probably squirt out.\n",

    "    - 1 green electrode for reference: This is the electrode all the electrodes are referenced to. See the re-referencing section for more about the reference electrode.\n",
    "    - 1 blue electrode for ground: This electrode serves as the ground for the circuit formed by the EEG.\n",

This overview is helpful in orienting them as to what will actually be happening to them for the next two hours. You should try to touch upon the following:\n",
    "  - EEG refers to measure of brain's electrical activity via this \"swimming cap\" which we'll be placing on your head. Point to an electrode and explain how it only records, does not stimulate.\n",
    "  - Also mention that there will be a few stand alone electrodes on the face and chest that also only record as well.\n",
    "  - You can mention that we'll be using a water-soluble gel to create electrical connections between the skin and electrode.\n",
    "  - MEG refers to the recording of the brain's magnetic fields. This is done in the magnetically shielded room to minimize interference via a \"helmet\" of sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Picking and Setting Cap: </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a Cap: Sizes range from 54-60 in sizes of 2 increasing by size of head. Smaller fonts for electrode labels are newer caps and tend to be better quality so you should be biased towards those if possible. You want to go for the smallest size that fits on subject's head that is still comfortable. If no good fitting caps are dry, you can use the blow dryer to dry a better one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check Electrodes: Once you have selected a cap, make sure to check for any electrodes that have popped out. If one has popped out, then you should stretch the cap around it and re-secure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fit Cap: \n",
    "  - The cap should be fit with two RA's. One with two hands on front and one with two hands on back. Place the front first, aligning FPz in the center of the forehead with a little bit of bare skin above the eyebrows (amount will vary by the head and cap). Once the front is placed, pull down on the back while holding the front in place. Pull until the cap is snug and there is no bunching. \n",
    "  - Press on all the electrodes to make sure none are too floaty or adjust accordingly. \n",
    "  - You may have to try more than one cap size if the initial one doesn't fit well. \n",
    "  - All heads get fit differently. Generally, the fit will be less tight in the back (especially with long hair). Also, the electrodes by the ears/on the ears will often be floating. There is typically nothing that can be done about this.\n",
    "  - The snugger the better so err for the snugger fit if a person is on the border between two cap sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Secure the Cap: Once the cap is fit on the head, ask them to velcro the chin strap so that it is tight and secure, but still comfortable. Make sure they can breathe and swallow comfortably (i.e. the strap is not too tight).\n",
    "\n",
    "PICTURE OF FIT CAP HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Filling the Cap Electrodes </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brief the Subject: Before you get started, explain to the subject what you will be doing\n",
    "  - Show them a cue tip with gel on it. Explain you will be working this in the electrodes to clean the skin/move hair. Reassure that they should let us know if any of the cue-tipping is uncomfortable.\n",
    "  - Show them a syringe with gel filled. Explain that you will be filling the electrodes with this gel to form the electrical connection.\n",
    "  - In both cases, reassure that the gel is water-soluble (can be washed off in sink in back after visit) and is hypoallergenic.\n",
    "2. Cue-Tipping an Electrode:\n",
    "  - For each electrode, swab the cue tip in some gel (on the paper towel). Place it inside the electrode and work back and forth to clean the area and move hair. The goal is to work the area until you have clear visibility of scalp (not always possible with lots of hair, do your best). \n",
    "  - Proper cue-tipping technique is best learned by visual demonstration so pay attention to technique of whoever is training you.\n",
    "  - Cue-tips should only be used for ~2-3 electrodes before being tossed and replaced. After a few electrodes, the cotton starts to dissolve making the end much harder and thus uncomfortable for the subject.\n",
    "3. Filling an Electrode with Gel:\n",
    "  - Once you have cleaned an electrode with the cue tip, the next step is to fill it. To do this, take your off hand and press down the electrode to the scalp with two fingers. While doing this, place the syringe in the electrode hole until contact with scalp is made. Then slowly press down on syringe filling the hole with gel while slowly moving the syringe and your hand away from the electrode until the hole is filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Placing the Peripherals </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prep the Electrodes: Place a circle electrode on the back of the electrode and peel off the backing. Then place a piece of skin tape behind, oriented according to the placement of the specific peripheral. Finally, fill the electrode with gel from a syringe.\n",
    "2. Inform the Subject: Warn the subject that you are about to wipe a cue tip on their face! Let them know the location.\n",
    "3. Take a cue tip with gel and scrub the area for several seconds to clean it. Locations for the various peripheral electrodes are depicted on the sheets on the wall by the hand sanitizer (with the exception of ECG which both go on each half of the chest, equally spaced from the center).\n",
    "4. Place the electrode with tape over the area and apply pressure to secure the tape. You can ask the subject to press down on it themselves to secure it so you don't have to press all over their face.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Special Note about the Reference*: The reference is the most important electrode as every other EEG electrode gets influenced by it and thus it is really important that it has a good connection. Because of this, we typically clean the nose for an extended period of time in step 3 (~1-2 minutes). Also, due to the awkward placement on the nose, we typically due this last and fold back two corners of the tape to keep it from overlapping the nostrils. Make sure to run the wire over the top of the head and tape it down to the cap (using one of the 1 inch pieces) once it is placed. This keeps it secure and out of the way.\n",

Here are some important dimensions to be aware of:\n",
    "- Task Understanding: It is important to try to assess whether you think the subject has a good understanding of the task. Do they make reasonable choices (for example, picking 20 over 5 dollars)? If there is a debriefing session, one can also assess this here.\n",
    "- Notable Artifacts: Make note of any peculiar artifacts/potential artifact sources. Is the subject moving a lot during the experiment? Are they sniffling/breathing heavy? Are they talking a lot? Try as best as you can to link up noise seen in the online signal collection display to actual movements/actions by the subject or other environmental influences.\n",
    "- Bad Electrodes: Note flat channels or channels that have really poor drift or multiple electrode pops. These channels may be fine, but these events suggest that they may not be trustworthy.\n",
    "- Subject Comments/Emotions: Patients, in particular, may have really strong emotions evoked. Try to assess how they are feeling and make not of any relevant comments they make. For example, are they really anxious or tired? Sometimes they will communicate directly via speech or other times you can infer from body language."

    "### Marking Bad Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important steps at this stage is to mark \"bad\" channels. These are channels that are determined to be unreliable or overly contaminated by noise and will not be used in any further analysis. Though there are some instances of noisy channels that are indisputably bad, often times it is unclear whether or not a channel should be marked as bad. There are not clear rules for how to decide in such situations, and ultimately it may come down to listening to your intuition or the intuitions of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some Pieces of Advice on Bad Channel Removal:**\n",
    "- Remember to remove the average re-reference prior to identifying bad channels (mne_browse_raw turns one on by default, so always remember to remove it). The average re-reference can propagate noise from bad channels to other channels making it less clear which channel is the source of the noise.\n",
    "- Check for repeat offenses: Do not reject a channel only because it shows a sudden spike of noise once or twice. Such artifacts tend to occur outside of trial (e.g. subject re-adjusts in seat), and will either wash out in averaging or be removed during epoch rejection. Only channels with systematic artifacts should be rejected.\n",
    "- Compare it to its neighbors: A channel may seem noisy from visual inspection, but if its behaving similarly to its neighbors, it might be worth keeping around. Neighboring channels should be highly correlated, so if a channel does not look like its neighbors, it is most likely contaminated by noise and should be rejected.\n",
    "- Try different filter levels: Some noisiness might be seen for higher filter levels (e.g. lowpass = 150 Hz) but will disappear almost entirely for more conservative filter settings (e.g. lowpass = 55 Hz). If this is the case, do not worry about rejecting the channel.\n",
    "- If you are on the fence about rejecting a bad channel take into account its location. You should be more likely to reject if in an area not of interest and less likely if you want to analyze the region that channel is from. \n",
    "- Line noise can be notch filtered and should not be the sole reason for rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some Examples of Bad Channels:**\n",
    "- <u>Flat Channels </u>: These channels are completely dead and will show as a flat line (see example below).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/flat_channels.png\">\n",
    "- <u>Crazy Stuff </u>: These channels don't have any particular phenotype other than they clearly do not reflect neural signal of any kind. See below for a few entertaining examples. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/crazy_channel_1.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/crazy_channel_2.png\">\n",
    "- <u>Deviation from Neighbor</u>: Some channels will have somewhat more subtle noise contamination and may even seem like reasonable signal on their own. However, they will stand out when compared to their neighbors. See below for a example.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/neighbor_deviation.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of More Subtle Bad Channel (EEG039). Note how it clearly stands out when compared to its neighbors however. </em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Poor Impedance</u>: As discussed in the advice, channels with poor impedance are typically on the fence depending on whether the noise is restricted to high frequencies (if so, can often be filtered out) and on the location of the channel. Below is an example of a few channels shown at high and low frequency lowpass cutoffs. In this case, the poor impedance contamination clearly persisted to low frequencies and thus I decided to reject these channels despite them being in the midfrontal region (the primary region of interest for this analysis). There is no clear correct answer as to whether they should be rejected however, and another researcher may have made a different call.\n",

    "\n",
    "I have the following columns in my spreadsheet for taking notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subject Tag: So we know which subject we're talking about.\n",
    "- Ratings @ 30, 50, and 100 Hz Low Pass: A subjective rating of quality of data at 30, 50, and 100 Hz low pass cutoff frequencies. Scale from 1-3 where 3 is high quality and 1 is poor quality. This serves as a quick overall summary of the quality of the data at the three main low passes I step through the data with (see next section). Ratings are obviously highly subjective so you should adjust scale to be meaningful to you. Generally, a 1 means this data is highly questionable and maybe should even be thrown out (especially if a 1 at 30 Hz). These ratings mainly will serve as a quick reminder of the quality of the data if you return to the data down the line during analysis.\n",
    "- Artifact Notes: I put all notes about artifactual contaminants that cannot be corrected with SSP here (see Types of Artifacts section below for examples). I will cross-reference the notes taken in the lab notebook during collection to see if there is any information about particular artifacts being generated and what caused them. I will add those notes here if they exist.\n",
    "- Bad Channels: The number of bad channels. This mainly serves as a reminder to apply the bad channels, but also gives a rough sense of how many channels you have available for that subject and is another indicator of the quality of the data.\n",
    "- Projection Notes: These are  notes I take about the presence of heartbeat and saccade artifacts (eye blinks are almost always present so I rarely make note of them). I will note here whether either are noticeably present and whether they frequently fall in trial periods and thus should be projected out.\n",
    "- Projection Columns: If I determine a projection is not needed I put N/A. If it is needed, I put needed and then completed when the projection has been applied. These just help me keep track of the needed projections.\n",
    "- I use the following color coding for subjects upon completion of projections:\n",
    "  - Green: Bad channels marked, projection computed and verified, and data is moderate to high quality.\n",
    "  - Yellow: Bad channels marked, projections computed and verified, but data is very poor, questionable quality. Essentially proceed with caution.\n",
    "  - Red: Data was of extremely poor quality and has been thrown out from analysis. If I determine a subject's data is of this poor quality, I will immediately mark there row red and move their raw data out to a separate rejected subjects folder so that it does not have any further processing done to it.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/eeg/raw_notes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Artifacts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Eye Blinks</u>: Will appear as U shaped hills. They will match the EOG vertical channel and should be most prominent in frontal channels and diminish as you move to occipitals. These can be projected out. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/eye_blink.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of eye blinks in frontal channels. Note how the artifacts match the shape of the vertical EOG channel and how they decrease in amplitude as you go more posterior (downwards).</em></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Saccades</u>: Often appear as square waves or plateaus. They will match the EOG horizontal channel and will be most dominant in frontal channels on the sides of the head. These can be projected out.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/saccade.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of saccades in frontal channels (to the right of green line marker). Note how the artifacts match the shape of the horizontal EOG channel and how they increase in amplitude in channels on the side of the head.</em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Heartbeat</u>: Will appear as regular spikes that will temporally align with the spikes in the ECG channel. They tend to be more pronounced in the temporal/occipital channels, but can permeate through most all channels. These can be projected out.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/heartbeat.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of heartbeats in temporal/parietal channels. Note how the timing of the spikes match the timing of the ECG spikes (green lines show timing of heartbeat spikes).</em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Poor Impedance</u>: This is fairly common and we affectionately refer to these artifacts as fuzzy caterpillars. These will be worst at higher frequencies, but may or may not contaminate lower frequencies (in which case they may be candidate for bad channel, see bad channel section). They will also typically contaminate the entire recording or a significant subset. If lower frequencies are not contaminated, a low pass filter will often help attenuate this artifact.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/poor_impedance.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of poor impedance in frontal channels (19-21). </em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Muscle/Movement Artifact</u>: This can take several forms and results from various types of movement or muscle activity including head motion, sniffling, jaw clenching, etc. Often it will show up as walls of noise (particularly high frequency, but can also affect lower frequencies) or as \"barbed wire\" spikes. Two characteristic traits are that it will involve high frequency noise (though severe movement artifacts can all cause low frequency activity shifts) and will be localized in time (not persist throughout the whole recording). Muscle artifact cannot be corrected and thus contaminated sections must be thrown out during epoch rejections and/or attenuated with a low pass filter. Two examples of different forms of muscle activity are pictured below, but beware that it can take many different forms!\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/muscle_1.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/muscle_2.png\">\n",
    "- <u> Alpha Waves </u>: Alpha waves are large amplitude alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz). Unlike the other artifacts, these are actual neural signals. However, depending on your analysis, these are often not neural signals of interest and thus are often considered as \"artifacts\" since they tend to dominate the data. There source is unclear, though it is thought they become more dominant in subjects who are tired, so this may be an index of how attentive/awake your subjects are. There is no real way to remove them (and it is really controversial as to whether one should), but the best option for handling alpha waves is pre-emptive: Make sure your tasks are engaging and subjects are staying alert! Example below. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/alpha.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of alpha waves in occipital channels. </em></div>\n",
    "- <u> Line Noise </u>: Electrical lines in the US oscillate at 60 Hz and sometimes this 60 Hz \"line noise\" can contaminate specific electrodes. Luckily, this activity is generally restricted to 60 Hz and can be removed with a notch filter or a low pass if not interested in high gamma activity (see section on filtering). Line noise can be determined by moving the low pass filter in mne_browse_raw from 58 to 62 Hz. If the noise in the channel all of the sudden appears, then this is line noise (otherwise it should more gradually increase with frequency).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/line_noise.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of line noise in EEG040. </em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Slow Drift/Sweat Artifact</u>: Slow drifts in voltage can result from changes in overall conductance over time. This will often happen as the subject begins to sweat in the cap. See below for an example (that may or may not be due to sweat). These drifts can be attenuated with a high pass filter (see the section on filtering).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/drift_sweat.png\">\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom: 30px\"><em> Example of slow drift in frontals. Note the very subtle slow wave activity. </em></div>\n",
    "- <u>Electrode Pops</u>: Occasionally electrodes will experience \"pops\", an example of which is pictured below. This happens because the interface between the electrode and the scalp functions as a capacitor and stores charge. Occasionally, these electrodes will have spontaneous discharges causing an instantaneous change in impedance which causes the vertical discontinuity in voltage. Electrode pops can be symptomatic of electrodes with poor connections and thus channels exhibiting pops should be carefully evaluated. Also, due to the sharp discontinuity introduced, electrode pops can be potential danger areas for filtering artifacts at later stages. Trials contaminated by pops are typically thrown out during epoch rejections (see the section on epoching).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/electrode_pop.png\">\n",
    "- <u>Cable Swing</u>: If the bundle of cables connecting the EEG electrodes to the amplifier swings, it can sometimes create a massive artifact across all channels where activity seemingly goes flat. This will often follow severe movement on the subject's part. Trials contaminated by cable swings are typically thrown out during epoch rejections (see the section on epoching).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/eeg/cable_swing.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As with bad channels, there are many more artifacts that can contaminate your data than listed above and many more forms of the artifacts listed above than in the given examples.

    "4. Mark any flat channels as bad.\n",
    "5. Low pass at 30 Hz. Click through the data slowly. Mark any channels that are clearly doing wonky things as bad. Note any artifacts. Record my rating @ 30 Hz.\n",
    "6. Set low pass to 50 Hz. Click through the data again and make note of any newly visible artifacts. Record my rating @ 50 Hz.\n",
    "7. Set low pass to 58 and then 62 Hz. Skim through to see if any channels have clear line noise and make note of it.\n",
    "8. Set low pass to 100 Hz. Click through and make note of new artifacts. At this high pass, poor impedance and motion become much more apparent. If there are particularly fuzzy channels, I will often return to 30 Hz high pass to see if they have noise at such low frequencies. If so, I may mark these channels as bad if I was previously on the fence about them (will also depend on their location). Record my rating @ 100 Hz.\n",
    "9. Look through occipitals/temporals for evidence of clear heartbeat artifact and make note of it.\n",
    "10. Look through and see if there is significant evidence of saccade contamination of trials to warrant a projection.\n",

    "Maxwell Filtering and motion correction are two separate preprocessing techniques for MEG. The former deals with removing noise contamination from external sources in the MEG and the latter deals with accounting for the subject motion during the recording. These techniques are covered in the same section because MNE has lumped them both into a single maxwell filter function (to make it more confusing, there are two separate maxwell filter techniques within this single function as well). However, the reason for this design choice is to maintain consistency with the Neuromag MaxFilter software (software written by the company that designed the MEG system) so they are the real ones to blame. Note that maxwell filtering should be done prior to any further processing on the MEG, however it is important that bad channels are marked prior to maxwell filtering as they will adversely influence the algorithm (the bad channels will get passed in). We'll first talk about the theory behind each of these techniques and then we'll talk about how to use them in MNE.\n",

The Neuromag software has the capability to perform motion correction and maxwell filtering in addition to extracting the HPI's.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory Behind ICA ###\n",
    "\n",
    "ICA has a very simple model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = As\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    " - x = observed data\n",
    " - A = linear mixing matrix\n",
    " - s = latent sources or components\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it hypothesizes that your observed data is a linear combination of unobserved (\"latent\") sources. To make this a bit concrete, we'll consider a slightly modified version of one of the original motivating problems behind ICA: the cocktail party problem. In this version of the cocktail party problem, a bunch of guests are having multiple separate conversations in a room. However, we missed the party and instead placed microphones evenly spaced throughout the room to record what was being said so we could later catch up on the gossip (yes, a little creepy but it makes the analogy hold). The problem is that every microphone doesn't record an individual conversation, but instead records a summation of all of the different conversations. Thus, we need some way to recover the individual conversations. This is exactly the problem that ICA sets out to solve. We have some observed data (the recordings) that are a linear combination (the microphones pick up weighted sums of conversation based on their distance from the microphone) of unobserved sources (the actual conversations) and our goal is to determine these sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does all of this have to do with ICA? Let's translate our example into M/EEG terms. Our \"conversations\" are different sources of electrical activity (both artifactual and coming from the brain), our electrodes or SQUIDs are the microphones, and these sensors pick up weighted combinations of the different sources. In mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x = # sensors x # time points matrix of recorded data\n",
    "- A = # sensors x # sources matrix of mixing weights\n",
    "- s = # sources x # time points matrix of electrical source activity\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the advantage in recovering these sources? It turns out that ICA is really good at separating out certain artifacts such as eye blinks, sacades, and heartbeats into specific sources. Thus we can take the decomposition into A and s, find the the specific sources that are artifactual, zero out the corresponding weights for this source in A, and finally recombine the data back into x, but now with the artifactual pieces removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Assumptions Behind ICA **\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating A and s from a single matrix x is a severely underdetermined problem. Consequently, we need to make a few assumptions in order for the technique to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>The sources must be independent</u>. Just as with our cocktail party where everyone is having their own separate conversations independently of the other conversations (perhaps there may be eavesdropping, but not in our example), the electrical sources must be independent of one another (we'll get more explicit about what independent means later). Most importantly the artifactual components must be independent of the neural signal components. What justifies this? Though we can't entirely ensure this, we can be fairly confident they are independent due to the fact these artifacts shouldn't generally be temporally correlated with signals of interest and that their spatial distributions are typically distinct from neural signals of interest.\n",
    "2. <u> The sources must be non-gaussian</u>: We discuss why this must be the case below. However, as to why this assumption is justified, artifacts tend to have non-gaussian process distributions. This is apparent from the fact that PCA does not work well for separating out the artifacts where ICA does (if the sources were gaussian then PCA would be equivalent to ICA).\n",
    "3. <u> The observed data must be a linear combination of the sources <u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "** Non-Gaussianity & PCA vs. ICA **\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA finds sources that are linearly uncorrelated (orthogonal) to one another, while ICA finds components that are fully independent of one another. Note that independence implies uncorrelatedness, but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of gaussian variables, uncorrelatedness does imply independence. Thus, for gaussian variables, PCA is sufficient and ICA will not be able to separate out the sources in any more meaningful way. In fact, ICA will not work with Gaussian variables. This is because for all orthogonal mixing matrices A, the multivariate distribution of As is identical if the sources are standard normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "pdf(Ax) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} e^{(Ax)^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} e^{x^TA^TAx} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} e^{x^Tx}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows from the fact that $A^{-1} = A^T$ for orthogonal matrices implying $A^TA = I$. Note that if the underlying sources are gaussian they will be transformed to standard normals by the whitening preprocessing step (see the preprocessing for ICA section).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Methods for estimating A and s: FastICA vs. Infomax **\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate A and s, we make use of the assumption that the sources are independent and of the following transformation variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = Wx = WAs\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, z is thus a linear combination of s as x was. However, we now have the ability to modify W in search of the matrix $A^{-1}$ which would make $z = s$. We simply need a measure for z that will let us know we have found s. That is, we need to know when we have maximized the independence of z because this implies we have found s. There are two different algorithms for finding W and s:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FastICA: FastICA maximizes the nongaussianity of z. This follows from the CLT, that states that sums of indepdnent random variables approach a gaussian. By extension, any linear combination of indpendent variables will be more gaussian than the variables themselves. Thus, the z that minimizes this measure is when $z = s$ and $W = A^{-1}$ because all other W's lead to some sources being linearly combined and thus more gaussian. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Infomax: Infomax is based on a neural network formulation that is equivalent to minimizing the mutual information of z. Mutual information is an information theory measure of independence that indexs how much information one variable contains about another. When two variables are independent, their mutual information is 0 (knowing something about one variable gives you no information about the other).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, maximizing nongaussianity and minimizing mutual information of z are equivalent. However, we have to find approximations for these measures which leads to differences in the practical realization of these algorithms. See the references section for papers giving details on these two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talk about MNE's implementations and comparing the methods in the practical section.\n",

    "### Why We Use ICA Over SSP \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab originally used SSP because two postdocs at the center advised we use SSP over ICA. However, since that time we have received 4 recommendations to use ICA over SSP. Two of these \"recommendations\" were based on past research collaborators of RA's who used ICA (note these weren't direct recommendations, but just observations that these two well versed EEG researchers used ICA and not SSP). The other two came in response to an email asking the MNE analysis mailing list which technique should be preferred. They made the following two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In my current experience, the differences between SSP and ICA are negligible, *when the methods are applied correctly*. The paper Tuomas linked contains two nice example of how not to apply SSP correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The authors didn't chance the default of removing 2 SSP components, where they should probably have used 1 in certain cases (EEG usually only has 1 EOG component). So it's no surprise they found that the signal was reduced as well as the noise. Take home message: always check that the number of components you remove is appropriate.\n",
    "  2. The authors never mention checking whether the extracted EOG epochs were correct. It is likely that they used the automated methods provided by MNE-Python blindly and just went with it. This could be acceptable in other studies (as long as the data is 'good enough' for the intended purpose), but certainly not in a study with the explicit focus on comparing noise reduction methods! Take home message: always check the EOG epochs found with the 'create_eog_epochs' function. Some things in the data (excessive movements by the subject, concatenating raw files that cause 'jumps' in the signal) can really mess up the automated algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In conclusion, I recommend the ICA pipeline in MNE-Python because that method is easier to apply correctly :) Notably because it doesn't rely on EOG event detection and because it has an automated manner of selecting the number of components to remove (plus the components are not orthogonal, so removing a second component is safer). But even with the ICA pipeline: double check the results! At the very least, check whether the noise components marked by the automated method make sense.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"They are not equally good because the methods are significantly different. SSP is less appropriate for ECG/EOG on statistical grounds. It learns spatial filters by extracting PCA components from the covariance computed over artifact samples. PCA assumes Gaussian distributions. But in our case these artifacts typically have skewed and/or peaky distributions, they are non-Gaussian and ICA happens to be designed for learning spatial filters from such signals. In my experience SSP can be good but often not good enough. It tends to remove too much or not enough and is more difficult to calibrate. This difference is less important for ERP/F analyses but they can matter for single trial and connectivity estimation. If you do decoding you don't have to bother either, your supervised model will learn the important patterns. However, SSP can do an excellent job however at global denoising when computed on empty room data. My 2 cents.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the first response was discrediting a paper that was linked in another response suggesting ICA was superior to SSP for SNR (not linked here because I agree with him that the paper was not thorough). The second response was in response to the first response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, given that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We had all of the previously discussed recommendations for ICA and the original SSP proponents at the center had since left and no SSP proponents spoke up on the mailing list.\n",
    "  - ICA is by far the more commonly used technique for EEG (and we haven't been able to find why the MEG community seems to use SSP relatively more).\n",
    "  - Alik is more familiar with ICA and thus more comfortable with it generally.\n",
    "  - There is a reasonable pipeline for ICA in MNE that seems to generaly work pretty well.\n",

    "### Theory Behind the Average Re-Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG recordings across electrodes are intimately linked to the reference electrode (See the section in Luck's ERP textbook for a good coverage of EEG referencing). Any noise particular to this reference will propagate to all other electrodes. One common employed method for dealing with such potential noise and other general global sources of noise is to re-reference each electrode to the average of all electrodes by subtracting the average activity of all the electrodes from each individual electrode. The rationale behind this decision is that activity common to all electrodes (which survives the averaging) is likely generated by some common noise artifact rather than any localized neural signature of interest and thus will be attenuated or removed upon subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though often used, the average EEG reference is still controversial. It is only recommended for high density montages (~ >= 60 channels) because of reasons discussed in the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dien, Joseph. \"Issues in the application of the average reference: Reviews, Critiques, and Recommendations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I defer more discussion of the average re-reference to this paper because it is a great overview. The takeaway is that it is potentially dangerous for lower density montages, but recommended for higher density montages such as those that we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Re-Reference in MNE\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-referencing to the average can be accomplished using a projection since it is a simple linear transformation (this is how it is done in MNE). In this case the projection vector is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = I - \\frac{1}{n}[1, 1, ..., 1]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of channels (this excludes bad channels). In MNE, the average EEG reference projection is added to the raw upon being loaded in and also gets added/applied during multiple different functions. For some of these, there is a parameter that you can change to prevent this from happening, but for others there is nothing you can do (including for the projections functions and the apply_proj() function) This is a really annoying design flaw with MNE and they are working on fixing it. The reason that this happens is that MNE by default assumes that your data are not properly referenced and the default reference they choose to impose is an average re-reference. You can explicitly tell MNE that your data are properly referenced using the set_eeg_reference function (see the SSP in MNE section for an example of using this function). Hopefully you can update this section with a more reasonable approach in an updated version of MNE (such as making the default that the data are properly referenced and then actually explicitly re-referencing). I like to be explicit about adding the average reference (using raw.add_eeg_average_proj), so see below how I add and apply it along with other existing projections. Note that one could not be explicit and simply let it be added automatically when loading in the raw or calling apply_proj, but this hides an important operation done to the data, which is why I try to refrain from doing so."

As such, filtering should be done with caution and one should be careful that their filters are constructed optimally to reduce unintended artifacts. This section provides a little overview on practical concerns you should consider when looking to apply filters to your data. For a great overview of filtering EEG data, see Luck's chapter on filtering in \"Introduction to the Event Related Potential\".\n",

There is less concern about introducing artifacts than with high pass filters, but generally one should insure that the frequency response function cutoff is not too steep to prevent ringing artifacts. Low pass filters will generally spread out peaks over time causing earlier onsets and later offsets. \n",

    "### High Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "High Pass filters are more contentious. High pass filters can be useful for cleaning up slow drift effects (maybe from sweat or irrelevant slow wave brain processes). However, high pass filters can attenuate and even reverse the polarity of ERP components. Furthermore, if the filter is not constructed properly, artifactual oscillations can be introduced. Steven Luck made an argument that a 0.1 Hz high pass is optimal and that higher high pass thresholds pose potential problems. Cohen, however, has used as high as 0.5 Hz. It is not clear what the correct approach is, although the conservative approach is to filter as little as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Control for your Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several things you can do to ensure proper use of filters:\n",
    "- Leave proper buffers of activity to prevent edge artifact contamination of your data. Do this for both the raw, but also when you construct epochs (due to filtering in time frequency decomposition techniques).\n",
    "- Visually inspect your filters to ensure that transition slopes are not too steep and to understand their temporal and frequency nature.\n",
    "- Compare results with and without filters to see the effects that the filters specifically are having on your results. Make sure a signal of interest is not actually an artifact of a poorly constructed filter.\n",

    "### Practical Consideration for Applying Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, you will want different low pass filters for your ERPs and your time frequency decompositions. Lower frequency cutoffs (such as 15-30 Hz) are often employed to clean up ERP plots since the ERP components of interest often occur as these frequency scales. However, one is often interested in higher frequencies for time frequency decompositions (maybe cutoffs of ~60 or so, or higher if specifically interested in gamma). Thus, two different sets of epochs with the same rejected trials, but different filters are needed. There are two options for how to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the raw data twice. And then create two sets of epochs from each filtered version of the raw. Use the version filtered at the higher frequency to reject bad epochs and then propagate those same rejections to the epochs with the lower cutoff filter.\n",
    "2. Filter the raw data at the higher frequency cutoff and create a single set of epochs. Then simply re-low pass the epochs for the ERPS manually when computing the ERPs. Be sure to leave plenty of filter buffer room to prevent edge artifact contamination.\n",

Be sure to include a sufficient amount of time prior to event for a baseline period and also potentially for a filter buffer (beyond the baseline period). For post event, include however much time you think there will be trial related activity as well as additional filter buffer.\n",
    "- baseline is a tuple defining the period to use for baseline normalization (dividing each epoch by the average of the baseline period). This gets all of the epochs on same relative scale and prevents distortion of baseline shifts across trials. The baseline period is generally chosen as the first couple 100 ms prior to the stimulus presentation/event. Generally, you want sufficient intertrial periods that are also randomly jittered in length so that their is no left over activity from the previous trial or predictive activity for this trial contaminating the baseline. IS THEIR A GOOD REFERENCE ON CHOOSING A BASELINE? Note that for events occuring at variable times during trials (such as responses) you will need to manually baseline normalize based on a stable baseline period (such as the pre-stimulus period).\n",
    "- reject allows you to change the peak-to-peak amplitude automatic rejection thresholds for epochs for different types of channels. For EEG, a reasonable range to explore is 70 - 250 e-6 (WHY? REFERENCE FIND). Some people elect to do manual rejections instead. We typically just do automatic rejections, but it is worthwhile to peak at the epochs after automatic rejection and make sure no clearly suspect epochs remain. You generally want at most 5ish% of epochs to be rejected. If more are being rejected, you might want to have a less stringent rejection amplitude or possibly revisit earlier preprocessing stages to see if more electrodes should be marked as bad (remember noise can creep across electrodes with the average reference projection). A good guiding principle is to drive your rejection amplitude low so that most subjects are only losing around 5-10% of trials. If specific individual subjects begin losing a lot more, check the drop logs to see if this is due to a particularly poor channel or small subset of channels.\n",
    "- detrend will let you remove a linear trend in your epochs. I think this could potentially serve as an alternative to a high pass filter, but I haven't seen evidence of it doing much to the epochs.\n",

    "Other considerations for epochs:\n",
    "- You may reject certain behavioral trials (outlier rejections, condition type, etc.). Make sure that the EEG events match these initial rejections.\n",
    "- In the other direction, you should remove behavioral trials where the EEG epoch was rejected due to data quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reference: Cohen Ch.'s\n",
    "\n",
    "As detailed in Cohen's chapter, Morlet Wavelet Convolution can be thought of as a time-varying Fourier transform. Rather than take a sinusoid as long as our data, we zero out all but the center of the sinusoid and then move this truncated sinusoid along our data. The result is like taking a bunch of mini time-localized overlapping Fourier transforms centered around each sample in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Understanding The Tradeoff Between Frequency & Temporal Resolution **\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we detail how MNE implements wavelet convolution, let's develop some intuition for how important parameters affect the nature of our wavelets. There are three main parameters that affect our wavelets:\n",
    "- The frequency of the wavelet: This specifies the frequency activity one is interested in investigating.\n",
    "- The number of cycles in the wavelet: This specifies how many cycles of the chosen frequency will NOT be zeroed out with the gaussian taper.\n",
    "- The sampling frequency of our data: This determines how many samples should be in our wavelet for a given cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is most important is understanding how these parameters interact to control your wavelet and also control the tradeoff between temporal and frequency resolution. Most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More Cycles = Better frequency resolution, poorer temporal resolution. The more cycles we have the less spread out the frequency content of the wavelet is and consequently the better frequency resolution we have. Greater frequency resolution means we can more accurately resolve the activity estimated by that wavelet to the frequency of the underlying sinusoid. However, greater frequency resolution comes at the cost of poorer temporal resolution. Having more cycles means the length of the non-zero component of your wavelet must increase, implying that the estimate of frequency content is smeared across a larger amount of time.\n",
    "- The tradeoff between frequency and temporal resolution is also dependent on the frequency of the wavelet. This is because the same number of cycles requires different lengths of time for different frequencies. For example, 5 cycles of a 5 Hz sinusoid takes 1 second, but 5 cycles of a 20 Hz sinusoid only takes .25 seconds! Thus, 5 cycles at a lower frequency will have a much lower\n",
    "- The sampling frequency doesn't directly affect the time/frequency resolution tradeoff, but it is very important to ensure that the oscillations in your wavelet actually match the appropriate frequency. The length of the wavelet will thus be scaled based on the actual sampling rate (since a wavelet of length 1000 is 1 second for a 1000 Hz sampling rate, but 2 second for a 500 Hz sampling rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To let you gather more intuition for how these parameters interact to produce the wavelets, I've created the interactive example below that plots the normalized real component of the wavelet (remember the actual wavelet being used is complex, read Cohen!!!) across time and also plots the normalized power spectrum of the wavelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things to keep in mind as you explore:\n",
    "- The sampling frequency is set to 1000 Hz. This is nice and intuitive because each sample is thus directly interpretable as 1 millisecond.\n",
    "- Be wary of the x-axis limits for the real component time plot. I tried to keep it relatively stable, but it does occasionally change to account for major shifts in temporal resolution.\n",
    "- The temporal resolution is defined as the (number of cycles / frequency) * 1000. This is the amount of time in the wavelet that is non-zero. The lower this is, the better the resolution.\n",
    "- The frequency resolution is summarized by the full width, half maximum (FWHM) measure. Since the spectra of each wavelet is approximately gaussian, the resolution is approximated by normalizing the spectra and then taking the width of the gaussian at the points that are closest to 0.5 on each side of the peak. Note that a higher FWHM implies greater resolution."

    "Two important intuitions:\n",
    "1. If you keep the frequency constant, more cycles implies greater frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution.\n",
    "2. If you keep the number of cycles constant, higher frequencies gives you greater temporal resolution at the cost of frequency resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the above intuitions, it is common to vary the number of cycles as a function of the frequency. You may want to keep temporal or frequency resolution constant across frequencies, or you may want to highlight one or the other in particular frequency bands. Exactly how you make the decision on what frequencies to include and the corresponding cycles is dependent on your particular analysis goals. A common approach is to take logarithmically spaced frequencies paired with logarithmically spaced cycles (say from 3 - 10 cycles). This keeps your relative frequency and temporal resolutions more similar across frequencies than if you just kept the number of cycles constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In source localization, our goal is to move from sensor space (electrodes on the head) to source space (neuronal sources in the brain). Mathematically, we can construct the problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = GD + n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- M is a # of channels x # of time points matrix detailing the sensor voltage readings at each time point. This is the actual data that we observe.\n",
    "- G is a # of channels x # of dipoles matrix detailing the lead field for each sensor. The lead field for a sensor describes how activity at each source dipole contributes to produce the voltage at that sensor. Each row of G can thus be thought of as each separate sensor's lead field. The lead field matrix G is determined by the forward model being used as well as the locations of the sensors and dipoles.\n",
    "- D is a # of dipoles x # of time points matrix detailing the magnitude and orientation of every source dipole. In general, everything pertaining to the dipole sources (location, orientation, and magnitude) are the unknowns we are trying to solve for, but some of these dimensions may be fixed based on anatomical constraints.\n",
    "- n is a spatial noise covariance ??\n",
    "\n",
    "This overarching formulation was pulled from a great overview of the problem in the \"Mathematical Formulation\" section of the following review paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "Review on solving the inverse problem in EEG source analysis by Grech et. al.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should go through this formulation to fill in the details omitted from the above simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following three sections, we'll talk both conceptually and practically (details of MNE modeling) about:\n",
    "\n",

This process results in a 3D reconstruction of the subject’s brain, with many useful items (e.g. brainmask, cortical labels) generated during intermediate steps. The 3D brain will ultimately be used at many steps along the DARPA analysis pipeline, including MEG/EEG analysis, ECOG/LFP analysis, and visualization. As such, it is a crucial step and deserves special attention. In the context of source localization, it is used to generate the BEM mesh files and to align the EEG and MRI coordinate systems. \n",

    "** Segment the Brain, Skull, & Scalp **\n",

    "The first step in the process is to generate the Boundary Element Model (BEM) surfaces. This involves first segmenting the brain, the skull, and the scalp and then producing surface meshes on the inside of the skull, the outside of the skull, and the scalp. For more information on the Boundary Element Model see the MNE page <a href=http://martinos.org/mne/stable/manual/appendix/bem_model.html#create-bem-model> here </a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different methods for doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> 1) Use a FLASH Scan </u> \n",
    "\n",
    "The FLASH scan uses a contrast that allows for better identification and separation of the brain, skull, and scalp surfaces. This is the preferred method and should be used if a FLASH scan is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make and change directory into a new folder for the FLASH scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "        cd $SUBJECTS_DIR/$SUBJECT\n",
    "        mkdir flash05\n",
    "        cd flash05\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use mne_organize_dicom to setup the directory as needed for the next step. This will copy over and organize the raw FLASH dicoms so that the segmentation can be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "        mne_organize_dicom 'path to the folder where the raw FLASH scan is stored' \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a symbolic link to the newly created FLASH folder so that MNE can find it. The flash directory created will likely be of a similar format to the following: '011_MEFLASH_8e_05deg'\n",
    "\n",
    "        ln -s 'Name of created FLASH directory' flash05\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make surfaces for the 3-layer BEM model. The following command creates an outer scalp layer (outer_skin.surf), an outer skull layer (outer_skull.surf), and an inner skull layer (inner_skull.surf) in the flash folder in the bem folder (and also other files which are further detailed in the MNE page linked above). The noflash30 option means the 30 degree flip angle will not be used as we do not acquire a FLASH scan with this flip angle.\n",

    "<u> 2) Use the Freesurfer Watershed Algorithm </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "If a FLASH scan is not available, one can use the Freesurfer watershed algorithm to do the segmentation directly on the subject's T1. This is not as accurate as using the FLASH, however, and the FLASH method should be used if a FLASH scan is available.\n",

    "1. Run the following command to make the surfaces for the 3-layer BEM model.

    "\n",
    "In brief, an M/EEG source is the summation of post synaptic potentials from thousands of spatially aligned dendrites. These sources are mathematically modeled as equivalent current dipoles. Generally, the primary substrate for these sources in the brain are cortical sheets of pyramidal neurons due to their parallel alignment and their proximity to the scalp, though EEG may be somewhat sensitive to deeper sources. EEG is maximally sensitive to radial dipoles (with lower sensitivity to tangential dipoles), while MEG is maximally sensitive to tangential dipoles (little to no sensitivity to radial dipoles).\n",

    "\n",
    "By reading all or a subset of these + doing your own pointed googling, you can probably get a good intuitive grasp of the theory behind the neuronal sources. It is always good to keep in mind that while many resources provide a simplistic view of the neuronal sources, the reality is extremely complex and not fully understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Neuronal Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of potential unknowns and decisions that has to be made when it comes to modeling the neuronal sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "** How many possible sources are there? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Different source localization methods make different assumptions/decisions. Single/multi-dipole models assume that only a small number of dipoles contribute, and actually search for the optimal locations of these small number of sources. This means that location is a further unknown they are also estimating. Distributed source models assume a grid of potential dipoles throughout the neural tissue. Thus, the locations are constrained and not estimated, and the other parameters of the dipole are estimated at every vertex in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Where are these sources? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, most models only assume sources in the cortical grey matter, though others may take deep sources into account. For the distributed source models constrained to cortex, a grid is usually fit onto the estimated grey matter surface from the subject's MRI.\n",
    " \n",
    "** What orientations do the dipoles have? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this can either be estimated or pre-constrained. Most notably, if you are using a subject's MRI to inform your source localization, you can use the 3D anatomical information to constrain the dipole orientation. For example, if you know that the current location is located on a cortical gyrus, you could constrain the orientation to be perpendicular to that gyral surface. Often when this is done, a \"looseness\" parameter allows the dipole some wiggle room to stray from this anatomical orientation constraint in the case of MRI reconstruction errors.\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Forward Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The EEG forward problem is that of determining the scalp potential of your various electrodes from some given configuration of neuronal dipole sources. This transformation is encaptured by the lead field matrix G in our mathematical formulation and it is necessary to generate such a matrix in order to be able to solve for the dipole unknowns. In general, we have to determine two things to set up our lead field matrix G. The first is determine which aspects of our source dipoles will be modeled as fixed vs. unknown. All of the following are components of the dipoles that must either be fixed according to some anatomical constraints or be solved for as unknowns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of source dipoles\n",
    "2. The location of each source dipole\n",
    "3. The orientation of each source dipole\n",
    "4. The magnitude of each source dipole\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll discuss the decisions made pertaining to the dipoles in the next section. The second thing we have to determine is a volume conductor model that specifies how electrical activity propagates from sources to the scalp sensors. Various volume conductor models are discussed in the subsequent section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume Conductor Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a model for your sources, we need a model for how the electrical activity in the brain propagates from these sources to the scalp. Specifically, the volume conductor model determines the lead field matrix G (the lead field describes the transformation of the dipole activity to scalp activity, each row of the matrix describing the field for a separate source).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the head is segmented into three different layers: neural tissue, the skull, and the scalp (sometimes the CSF is modeled as a 4th layer), which each have their own electrical conductivities. Most models consider each layer to be electrically homogenous, but some may take more detailed anatomical information into account and actually model smaller portions of each layer separately. Most notable about the layers, is that the scalp is much less conductive. This property leads to a problem known as spatial blurring where the electric field gets spread out across sensors as a result. To visualize this, imagine a wave hitting a wall with tiny holes in it. The wave will hit the wall and splatter out to the sides due to the extra resistance proposed by the wall with small amounts of water seeping through all along the way. This is not a perfect analogy by any means, but what is important is to understand that the current will move tangential to the skull in response to the introduction of the high resistance. Note that in MEG, the skull and scalp are usually ignored because the skull does not distort magnetic fields to the extent that it does electric fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "The propagation of electrical activity from the source dipoles across these layers is determined by quasi-static approximations to Maxwell equations. Specifically, these equations paired with the electrical properties of the medium allow one to determine how electrical activity at a point in one layer would transfer to ensuing points in other layers. This is dependent on how you actually discretize and model the different layers. We discuss several of the main approaches below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spherical Model: In the spherical model, the head is modeled as a perfect sphere which each layer being a certain slice of the sphere (kind of like the Earth). In this case, an analytical solution exists for determining the scalp potential based on the sources. However, the sphere model is not a very accurate model of the actual head.\n",
    "- Boundary Element Method (BEM): BEM simply models the boundaries that provide the interface between each layer. It uses an MRI to create these 3d boundaries along the neural matter, skull, and scalp. Then it tesselates these surfaces with triangles where each of the vertices defines a point where activity will be determined. Importantly, it assumes that conductivity within each layer is homogenous. Thus, the electrical activity at each vertex in a layer can be computed using the distance information between vertices provided by the MRI, starting with the inner layer of the skull from the sources and then ending with the scalp. BEM is a good tradeoff between incorporating actual subject specific anatomical information, but still being fairly compuationally tractable. This is the method used in MNE and so we'll talk more about it in the practical section.\n",
    "- Finite Element Method (FEM): FEM still uses an MRI to segement the three layers, but it instead tesselates the volumes with tetraheders (pyramids with a triangle base), rather than just modeling the layer interfaces as in BEM. This provides the added advantage that each tetraheder can be given its own conductivity values to more accurately reflect anatomically informed variation within a layer. This comes at the expense of greater computational cost, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not estimating the locations of your dipoles, the lead field matrix G can be precomputed using your source model dipole locations and your volume conductor model.\n",

    "### Minimum Norm Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I will detail the theory behind MNE's minimum norm estimate inverse methods. First, I want to introduce the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- G: G is the lead field matrix. Specifically, every row of G describes how a specific sensor activity is composed of unit dipoles at all of the positions across the brain that are being modeled.\n",
    "- S: S is the source dipole vector. It either contains dipole magnitude information or both magnitude and orientation information. In the former, it has a length = to the number of source dipoles being modeled. In the latter, it has a length 3 times that (3 points for each orientation component of each dipole: 1 radial, 2 tangential). If orientation is not estimated, it is assumed to be fixed to the normal component to the cortical surface.\n",
    "- M: M is the sensor measurement vector. This is the actual observe M/EEG recordings. It has dimensions based on the number of channels.\n",
    "- Note that G is the same across time, but both M and S are time varying. We estimate S at every time point with the assumption that time points are independent.\n",
    "- Note that the expected true relationship is M = GS, but there is noise in our measurement which we must additionally model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'm going to provide a bayesian formulation of the problem. Our goal is to determine the posterior density $p(S|M)$. More specifically, we are going to use the MAP (maximum value of the posterior) estimate to determine our most likely source configuration. From Baye's rule we know the following:\n",

    "Our goal is thus to maximize $p(M|S)p(S)$ (the denominator can be ignored without changing the maximum).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the the likelihood $p(M|S)$ as follows: We'll assume that the forward solution $GS$ would give us the true sensor signal. However, we know that the M/EEG measurements are noisy and so we model this noise as additive gaussian noise with mean 0 and spatial noise covariance matrix C. Thus our sensor data can be captured by the following:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "M = GS + N(0,C)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Artifact Correction with Signal Space Projections (SSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "** This section was written when the lab still used SSP to correct artifacts. However, we then switched to ICA as our primary mehod instead of SSP for reasons discussed in Why ICA Over SSP? section of the appendix. This section is still included here as an educational resource. **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've looked through the raw data and marked bad channels, the next step is to correct common physiological artifacts including eye blinks, saccades, and heartbeat artifacts. In the lab we use SSP to correct these artifacts, but another more common method that you can explore that MNE also implements is ICA (not covered in this guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal Space Projection (SSP) is an EEG preprocessing technique used to clean up common EEG artifacts such as eye blinks, saccades, and heartbeat artifacts. Because I have not found a satisfactory explanation of the SSP technique, the first part of this section provides a tutorial of the theory behind SSP. The second part then walks through the practical details of how we use it in MNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSP Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formulation of SSP\n",
    "\n",
    "The main paper on the SSP technique is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uusitalo, M. A., and R. J. Ilmoniemi. 1997. “Signal-Space Projection Method for Separating MEG or EEG into Components.” Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 35 (2): 135–40.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found this paper hard to follow so I have written a more approachable overview of the technique here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model for SSP is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b(t) = b_s(t) + b_n(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b(t)$ is an n dimensional vector corresponding to an eeg recording with n electrodes at time t. $b_s(t)$ is an n dimensional vector corresponding to the signal component of the eeg. $b_n(t)$ is an n dimensional vector corresponding to the noise component of the eeg. All this equation is saying is that the observed EEG data is simply a combination of a signal component and a noise component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of SSP is to find some linear operator to apply to our data such that we retain the signal component, but eliminate the noise component. In linear algebra terms, we are looking for P such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Pb(t) \\approx b_s(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we want $Pb_s(t) \\approx b_s(t)$ and $Pb_n(t) \\approx 0$. To eliminate the noise component, our goal is to construct P such that it is orthogonal to the noise term making its inner product with the noise term 0. This matrix P is known as the signal-space projection operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know that $b_n$ is characterized by multiple individual characterizable noise components $b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$ (for example eye blink, saccade, etc.) then we know we can rewrite $b_n$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_n = c(t)U + \\epsilon(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where U is a spatial orthornormal basis for the known sources of noise that we can characterize into different components (an orthornormal basis for $b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$), c(t) are the time varying coefficients to reconstruct the observed noise, and $\\epsilon(t)$ captures all the noise that we cannot easily characterize. Here we assume that $\\epsilon(t)$ is small enough to discount and does not exhibit any spatial biases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our goal is to find P such that $Pb_n(t) \\approx 0$. It turns out that the desired projection operator is $P = I - UU^T$ where I is the identity matrix. Below shows why this is the desired operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Pb_n(t) &= (I - UU^T)(c(t)U + \\epsilon(t)) \\\\\n",
    "&= c(t)U - c(t)UU^TU + \\epsilon(t) - UU^T\\epsilon(t) \\\\\n",
    "&= c(t)U - c(t)IU + \\epsilon(t) - UU^T\\epsilon(t)\\quad \\text{The transpose of an orthornomal matrix is also its inverse.}\\\\\n",
    "&= 0 + \\epsilon(t) - UU^T\\epsilon(t)\\quad \\text{Epsilon is assumed to be small and thus is approximately 0}\\\\\n",
    "&\\approx 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because there is always going to be some noise in the signal, $\\epsilon(t)$ will never be 0 and thus the projection won't perfectly remove all of the noise even in the ideal case where you perfectly capture and remove all of the characterizable portion of $b_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing to ensure is that $Pb_s(t) = b_s(t)$. Because $Pb_s(t) = b_s(t) - UU^Tb_s(t)$ we want the second term $UU^Tb_s(t)$ to be 0. This is achieved if the noise basis U is orthogonal to the signal $b_s(t)$ because this makes $U^Tb_s(t) = 0$. Note that SSP is thus dependent on the assumption that the signal and the noise space are orthogonal (or in practice, ideally close to orthogonal) for the projection operator to leave the signal intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus all that is needed to apply SSP projections is a basis U to construct the projection operator. We'll talk about how MNE constructs such a basis in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructing the Artifact Basis U\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important points we haven't yet touched upon is how to compute the artifact basis U. Given a well characterized artifact (eye blink, heartbeat, saccade), we want to create a matrix U that serves as an orthonormal basis that can completely characterize that artifact's spatial representation. The way MNE does this is by taking a lot of periods in the data where the artifact is relatively dominant compared to other signal and then doing a PCA decomposition on these periods of activity to get an eigenvector basis (this is our U) for activity that best represents the effect of that artifact. Below is a step by step of the process MNE employs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MNE has built in algorithms for detecting eye blinks, saccades, or heartbeats in the EOG and ECG channels (i.e. a peak finder for eye blinks). It will use this algorithm to create a list of eye blink, saccade, or heartbeat temporal events.\n",
    "2. These events are used to epoch the raw data to generate a bunch of short slices of data that are thus dominated by this artifact. \n",
    "3. Next a PCA decomposition is done by constructing a spatial covariance matrix across these epochs (Construct the cross-covariance between each channel to fill in a slot in the covariance matrix. This process creates an estimate of the covariance matrix for each epoch which can then be averaged at the end for an overall estimate. Or alternatively the epochs are first averaged and then the covariance matrix is estimated from the cross covariance between each of the averaged channels.). This covariance matrix estimate can then be decomposed and an orthornormal eigenvector basis matrix can be extracted from this decomposition (orthornormal because a covariance matrix is symmetric positive-definite). This description stops short of a full review of PCA so find a good tutorial for that technique if you are confused here. This eigenvector basis serves as our desired orthornormal basis U! \n",
    "4. Finally, there is still a major decision to be made for our U matrix: How many PCA components (eigenvectors) should we keep in the U matrix for applying the projection. We'll talk about how to make this decision in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining the Number of Components to Keep\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding the number of PCA components to keep in our U matrix is an important decision and unfortunately is largely subjective. Unlike many PCA applications, where an amount of variance explained metric can be used to limit the number of components, the most important determining factor here is the effect of removing/adding components on your data. We've found that the best way to evaluate this is to actually view the change in the raw data as you add and remove components (I like to start with 1 component and only add more if I think the artifact has not been adequately projected out). Generally, the components that explain most of the variance will also remove most of the artifact since we deliberately chose sections of the data where the artifact is dominant. However, as you get to later components, the tradeoff between extra artifact removal and potential signal removal seems to increase. I've found that in the majority of cases the first component is sufficient to remove the majority of the eye blink peak in the data based on visual inspection. Occasionally another component will help, but I like to be conservative because these later components don't have as much effect on removing eye blink artifact (at least visually) and they also tend to greater affect other non-eye blink periods of the data as well. Unfortunately, there is no clear objective metric. Instead, it is best to calculate multiple components and then spend time removing components one by one and get comfortable deciding on the tradeoff yourself based on visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main assumptions that SSP rests on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The basis set U should be able to characterize the artifact we are interested in removing well.\n",
    "2. The noise and signal subspaces should be orthogonal to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1 relies on the fact that we can construct a matrix U that well characterizes the artifact we are interested in projecting out. If this is not true, then the projection operator will not reliably remove the artifactual component of the recording and your signal to noise ratio will suffer. Our method of constructing U relies on the fact that we both pick specific parts of the data where the artifact is clearly present to estimate U and that these artifacts (saccades and eye blinks in particular) are generally orders of magnitude larger than our signal, meaning they should dominate the decomposition at those times.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 2 relies on the fact the noise and signal spaces should ideally be orthogonal or as close as practically possible. If this is not true, then the projection operator will also remove/attenuate the signal component of the recording. It is unclear to what degree assumption 2 is valid, though the technique has been used often and papers were published on SSP specifically for eye blink and hearbeat artifact removal (can't find pdfs online, see references of main SSP paper listed above). In practice, the signal and noise component are likely not fully orthogonal and so one must be careful and wary about removing signal. There are a few reasons why it may be reasonable to assume that the two are sufficiently orthogonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Signals of interest should in most cases not be temporally correlated with eye blinks, saccades, or artifacts. This means, when you average over these periods, their spatial relationships should not seep into the covariance matrix.\n",
    "2. Remember that U is a spatial basis for the artifact. This means that for signal to be attenuated it must have the same spatial relationship as the artifact to get full eliminated. Since most signals of interest are generally thought to be localized to specific areas, while most artifacts are spread more widely across electrodes, there shouldn't be as much overlap. However, the projections can definitely affect the data outside of the main artifact wave, particularly in the channels where the artifact is dominant. For example, with eye blinks, the magnitude of the artifact contamination drops off as you move posterior. Thus, when you apply the projection, the waveforms in the very frontal channels get affected quite a bit, but as you move posterior, they have less affect outside of the eyeblink region.\n",
    "3. We limit the number of components we use in constructing U (typically to 1). This is based on the idea that the maximum amount of variance in these regions should be determined by the artifact's spatial characteristics. If signal representation did seep in, it may be the case that if fell into later components, so not including these prevents it from being projected out. It is a conservative approach that seems to still remove the artifact reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSP in MNE \n",
    "\n",
    "MNE has its own Projection class for handling projections. This class stores the signal space operator for that projection. These projection objects can then be added (think attached) to Raw objects. Finally, they can either be explicitly applied to the data or get automatically applied by MNE at different processing points where applied refers to replacing the original raw data with the dot product of the signal space projection operator and the raw data to remove the artifact.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Un-Applying the Average Re-Reference Projection **\n",
    "\n",
    "See the average re-reference section for more information on the average re-reference. The first step after reading in the raw data is to tell MNE that the raw data is already appropriately referenced. Without doing this, MNE will automatically add an average re-reference projection at a bunch of different points throughout the processing pipeline (it's really annoying), including when the raw data is first read in or visualized in mne_browse_raw. In fact, it is currently impossible to compute EOG and ECG projections without having the average re-reference applied first unless you explicitly tell MNE that the data are already properly referenced (MNE developers are working on fixing this and making the reference process much more reasonable, so if this has changed when you are reading this, please update).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we not average re-reference prior to computing EOG & ECG projections? When you average re-reference, the artifactual signals both get attenuated in many channels, but also spread to other channels where they were not present. This means that our periods used to estimate the artifact subspace will be relatively less dominated by the artifact and that channels that wouldn't have otherwise been affected by the projections will now be affected. Note that this was originally my intuition, but Alik and a MNE developer agreed. However, another MNE developer said it shouldn't matter whether it gets applied prior to or after so you can dig more into it if you're curious.\n",
    "\n",

You should scroll through the raw toggling them on and off and visually verify that the artifacts are being removed and that nothing crazy is happening to the rest of your data. If you notice that artifacts aren't sufficiently being attenuated you can always go back and add in more components for that particular subject. Or if you started with multiple components and noticed that some of the latter components don't seem to be having much effect on the artifact, you can return and reduce the number of components for that subject (it is best to be conservative as you want to do as little as possible to your data).
